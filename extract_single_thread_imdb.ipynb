The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], 'Name: ': 'Margaret Thatcher', 'id: ': '0857137', 'Title: ': '6 Days', 'Genre: ': ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller']}}]\n"

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Maurizio Nichetti\\'s charming and quirky comedy blends live action and animation in a lighthearted, though cheerfully lightweight, love story.Nichetti\\'s fondness for combining fantasy with reality is again given reign with a story of Maurizio, a sound dubber looking for love. Shy, bumbling, and naive, he devotes himself to his low-paying job by recording odd sounds - people falling over, hammers tapping, wandering the streets of his town looking for the perfect accompaniment to old-fashioned and out-of-fashion cartoons. His brother Patrizio (Patrizio Roversi) is exasperated by his lack of initiative in love and provides a hilarious foil as a director of soft-porn \"art films\" with a bevy of non-Italian-speaking, lingerie-clad aspiring actresses. He ends up offering to employ Maurizio as a sound technician for one of these lurid films, with the hope that it will add some courage to his love life.The introduction of Angela Finocchiaro\\'s Martina provides the romance Maurizio seeks - a working-girl who specializes in fetishes, fulfilling some of the most comical and interesting fantasies with a tender and accepting smile. Twin architects get to clean her apartment and watch her shower; a taxi driver gets to take her on full-speed races around Rome just to hear her scream and with a fantastic spin on The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, a chef decorates her in bittersweet chocolate - and tops it off with a flourish of confectionary.Their chance meeting ends up with Maurizio becoming accidently entangled in the working life of Martina and becoming part of the clients stories. Delighted with his non-judgmental attitude, Martina asks him on a date... which leads to the weirdest development yet. Maurizo\\'s shy nature suddenly becomes implicit as he begins to turn into a cartoon, limb by limb. Fleeing the date, things only get worse as his hands develop ideas of their own and he disastrously presents his soundtrack ideas to a horrified Patrizio.Can he keep his developing animated state hidden? Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love? Nichetti hasn\\'t made a Titanic or Gone With the Wind - but as a modern, quirky tale that implicitly questions preconceptions about kinky consensual relationships, it succeeds beautifully.

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure.

He ends up offering to employ Maurizio as a sound technician for one of these lurid films, with the hope that it will add some courage to his love life.The introduction of Angela Finocchiaro\\'s Martina provides the romance Maurizio seeks - a working-girl who specializes in fetishes, fulfilling some of the most comical and interesting fantasies with a tender and accepting smile. Twin architects get to clean her apartment and watch her shower; a taxi driver gets to take her on full-speed races around Rome just to hear her scream and with a fantastic spin on The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, a chef decorates her in bittersweet chocolate - and tops it off with a flourish of confectionary.Their chance meeting ends up with Maurizio becoming accidently entangled in the working life of Martina and becoming part of the clients stories. Delighted with his non-judgmental attitude, Martina asks him on a date... which leads to the weirdest development yet. Maurizo\\'s shy nature suddenly becomes implicit as he begins to turn into a cartoon, limb by limb. Fleeing the date, things only get worse as his hands develop ideas of their own and he disastrously presents his soundtrack ideas to a horrified Patrizio.Can he keep his developing animated state hidden? Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love? Nichetti hasn\\'t made a Titanic or Gone With the Wind - but as a modern, quirky tale that implicitly questions preconceptions about kinky consensual relationships, it succeeds beautifully. Consider it a social-comment confectionary with a hint of cartoon chocolate.']], [['Two men rattle a comic-book artist who has moved to a desert town after her trauma in New York.::Anonymous', \"After surviving rape, comic-book artist Lisa Roberts is moving from New York City to small town in Arizona.

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

Meanwhile, her coworker, Helenka (a cook), doesn't hear a thing, and begins to worry about Anna's state of mind...::Anonymous\"], 'House of Voices', ['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Mystery'], [{'name': 'Virginie Ledoyen', 'id': '0001461'}, {'name': 'Lou Doillon', 'id': '0230697'}, {'name': 'Catriona MacColl', 'id': '0531529'}, {'name': 'Dorina Lazar', 'id': '0493668'}, {'name': 'Virginie Darmon', 'id': '0201469'}, {'name': 'Jérôme Soufflet', 'id': '1407982'}, {'name': 'Marie Herry', 'id': '1696027'}, {'name': 'Eric Prat', 'id': '0695309'}, {'name': 'Marin Chouquet', 'id': '1909545'}, {'name': 'Christophe Lemaire', 'id': '0501035'}, {'name': 'Louis Thevenon', 'id': '2902716'}, {'name': 'Franck Vestiel', 'id': '0895367'}], ['One of the tensions of this film set in France, is between the film\\'s present (1958) and the past (1946). This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk.

Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet. Alton magically helps Sevier steal a car.In the morning, Sevier turns over Alton to Roy and Sarah. He handcuffs himself with Lucas cuffs and asks if Lucas would be willing to punch him which Lucas has no interest in doing.Alton tells Roy that theres one route they can go to get through the government roadblocks keeping them from their final destination. Roy and Sarah also come to terms with the fact that Alton might not belong with them after all and that once they get there, its goodbye.They drive through a small military blockade on a country road. Alton and Sarah get out of the car and run through swamp land. Roy and Lucas keep the military occupied while driving in Sarahs, now badly damaged, car.As if by magic, a dome appears around Alton that takes up a good third of the United States. Everywhere, everyone sees this magical world where Alton belongs. All of the beings that inhabit that world are made of light that comes from their hands and eyes, kind of like an evolved version of Alton. Lucas and Roys car crashes. Alton and Sarah share a goodbye glance and then as suddenly as everything appeared, it, along with Alton disappears.AFTERMATHLucas is being questioned by the government. His incredible story is the only story he has to tell. Sarah cuts her hair in a scummy bathroom clearly on the run. Roy is in a prison. He has electrodes on his head and stares into the sun.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed. Then all of the nearby payphones start ringing at once. He picks up. On the other end, Sevier tells him that he has Alton and tells Roy where they can meet. Alton magically helps Sevier steal a car.In the morning, Sevier turns over Alton to Roy and Sarah. He handcuffs himself with Lucas cuffs and asks if Lucas would be willing to punch him which Lucas has no interest in doing.Alton tells Roy that theres one route they can go to get through the government roadblocks keeping them from their final destination. Roy and Sarah also come to terms with the fact that Alton might not belong with them after all and that once they get there, its goodbye.They drive through a small military blockade on a country road. Alton and Sarah get out of the car and run through swamp land. Roy and Lucas keep the military occupied while driving in Sarahs, now badly damaged, car.As if by magic, a dome appears around Alton that takes up a good third of the United States. Everywhere, everyone sees this magical world where Alton belongs. All of the beings that inhabit that world are made of light that comes from their hands and eyes, kind of like an evolved version of Alton. Lucas and Roys car crashes. Alton and Sarah share a goodbye glance and then as suddenly as everything appeared, it, along with Alton disappears.AFTERMATHLucas is being questioned by the government. His incredible story is the only story he has to tell. Sarah cuts her hair in a scummy bathroom clearly on the run. Roy is in a prison. He has electrodes on his head and stares into the sun.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset.

Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.::GFC', \"On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with the Ayatollah Khomeini deposing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One is Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin of the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporter Kate Adie who is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.::Huggo\"], '6 Days', ['Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller'], [{'name': 'Jamie Bell', 'id': '0068260'}, {'name': 'Mark Strong', 'id': '0835016'}, {'name': 'Abbie Cornish', 'id': '0180411'}, {'name': 'Martin Shaw', 'id': '0789864'}, {'name': 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'id': '0683116'}, {'name': 'Ben Turner', 'id': '1883181'}, {'name': 'Emun Elliott', 'id': '2047170'}, {'name': 'Aymen Hamdouchi', 'id': '3043480'}, {'name': 'Andrew Grainger', 'id': '0334431'}, {'name': 'Colin Garlick', 'id': '4292312'}, {'name': 'Colin Moy', 'id': '0610325'}, {'name': 'Toby Leach', 'id': '0494874'}, {'name': 'Martin Hancock', 'id': '0359398'}, {'name': 'Xavier Horan', 'id': '1901866'}, {'name': 'Te Kohe Tuhaka', 'id': '2702696'}, {'name': 'Robert Portal', 'id': '0691928'}, {'name': 'William Chubb', 'id': '0160949'}, {'name': 'Ronan Vibert', 'id': '0895812'}, {'name': 'John Henshaw', 'id': '0378132'}, {'name': 'Tim Downie', 'id': '0236071'}, {'name': 'Sam Snedden', 'id': '3261651'}, {'name': 'Mia Blake', 'id': '1632485'}, {'name': 'Matthew Sunderland', 'id': '0839146'}, {'name': 'Emma Campbell-Jones', 'id': '2115864'}, {'name': 'Jared Turner', 'id': '1497752'}, {'name': 'Calum Gittins', 'id': '1275727'}, {'name': \"Ryan O'Kane\", 'id': '2266870'}, {'name': 'Fayssal Bazzi', 'id': '2417960'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Collard', 'id': '0171674'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Boulton', 'id': '0099610'}, {'name': 'Michael Denkha', 'id': '0219285'}, {'name': 'Scarlett Featherstone', 'id': '7766847'}, {'name': 'Venice Harris', 'id': '7766848'}, {'name': 'Marjan Gorgani', 'id': '2750727'}, {'name': 'Jeff Szusterman', 'id': '0844351'}, {'name': 'Phil Peleton', 'id': '2866455'}, {'name': 'Kip Chapman', 'id': '1368455'}, {'name': 'Ajay Vasisht', 'id': '1271108'}, {'name': 'Scott Michael Wagstaff', 'id': '5720460'}, {'name': 'Brady Powell', 'id': '5942904'}, {'name': 'Jay Sutherland', 'id': '3247166'}, {'name': 'Joel Beckett', 'id': '0065695'}, {'name': 'Alan B.

Will he succeed as a soundtrack creator for pornography? And most importantly... has he found love?

According to the yearbook, Mary Ann\\'s goal is to be rich and live in an exotic land. She pursues her goal in a calculated, manipulative, and ruthless manner that includes a switch of identities.The following synopsis describes events in chronological order, but the viewer learns many of the events only at the end of the movie.Mary Ann Simpson gets involved in bad things after high school, but then sets her sights on wealthy Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). She knows Walker will not marry her if he finds out about her past. She decides to adopt the identity of her high school classmate Matty Tyler. As Matty Tyler, she arranges to meet Edmund Walker. They get married and move to a waterfront estate in Pine Haven, Florida. Edmund travels frequently and is involved in many business dealings, including an investment in an abandoned beachfront hotel nearby.Edmund\\'s will leaves much of his estate to his niece. Matty Tyler Walker (the real Mary Ann) knows that if his will is invalidated for any reason, she would inherit all his estate as the surviving spouse under state law of intestacy. Matty devises a plan to murder Edmund and get all of his estate. To carry out the plan, she must find an attorney to commit the murder and forge a new, invalid will. She will then implicate the attorney as the murderer and kill him in what looks like an accident to end any further investigation.Ned Racine (William Hurt) is a slightly disreputable attorney. One of the wills he drafted was invalidated and he was sued for legal malpractice. His best friends are prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston).At a party, Matty Tyler Walker meets an attorney who tells her about the legal malpractice case against Ned. Matty decides that Ned is the perfect target for her scheme. Matty arranges to meet Ned and they begin a hot affair. She eventually talks Ned into murdering Edmund. Ned gets advice on arson devices from his client Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke). Matty asks Ned to change Edmund\\'s will and forge his signature. He refuses because he thinks it will attract attention.As the murder plans develop, Ned makes a surprise visit to see Matty and finds another woman meeting with Matty. Matty introduces her as \"Mary Ann Simpson,\" but unknown to Ned (or to the viewer) she is actually the real Matty Tyler. The real Matty Tyler has learned about Matty Tyler Walker\\'s deception and is blackmailing her. Matty Tyler Walker must now alter her plans to also get rid of the real Matty.On the night Edmund is to be killed, Ned goes to Miami and checks into a motel to give himself an alibi. He then drives back to Edmund and Matty\\'s house and murders Edmund. He takes Edmund\\'s body to the abandoned beachfront hotel and sets it on fire, hoping to make it look like Edmund tried to commit arson and was accidentally killed in the process. While Ned is gone setting the fire, Matty telephones the front desk of Ned\\'s motel repeatedly and asks to speak with Ned. The front desk rings Ned\\'s room but no one answers. Matty knows that Ned is not there and that his failure to answer the telephone calls will destroy his alibi.After the murder and the fire, Ned is shocked to learn that Matty changed the will and made it appear that Ned was involved. The redrafted will is invalid and, as a result, all of Edmund\\'s estate passes to Matty. When Edmund\\'s estate is eventually settled, Matty sends all the money to a secret bank account overseas.Oscar Grace and Peter Lowenstein investigate Edmund\\'s death. They learn that Edmund\\'s body was discovered without his glasses. If his glasses are found elsewhere, it would suggest he was murdered elsewhere and his body then taken to the hotel. They also discover the motel telephone records that show Ned did not stay in his Miami motel room the night of the death. They reluctantly begin to suspect their friend Ned.Meanwhile, Matty Tyler Walker has developed a revised plan that will get rid of both Ned and the real Matty. The first part involves a made-up story that her former housekeeper has Edmund\\'s missing glasses and is threatening to turn them over to the police unless she is paid off. If the glasses are kept from the police, there would still be a chance that Edmund\\'s death would be ruled an accident rather than a homicide. The second part of the plan is to murder the real Matty and place her body in the boat house at her estate. The third part is to send Ned to the boat house on the pretext of recovering the glasses. The boat house will be rigged to explode a few seconds after the door is opened.Before Matty can fully execute her plan, Ned happens to meet the attorney who originally told Matty about him. Ned suspects he has been set up. Then Teddy Lewis tells Ned that Matty had asked him questions about rigging a delayed explosion.Matty Tyler Walker murders the real Matty Tyler and puts her body in the boat house. She then calls Ned and tells him the housekeeper has been paid off and has left the glasses in the boat house. Matty asks Ned to go to the boat house and pick them up. Ned goes to the the boat house, carefully inspects it, and sees the trip wire on the door. Matty arrives, expecting to find the boat house destroyed with the bodies of Ned and the real Matty inside. She is startled to see Ned alive and the boat house intact. Ned tells Matty that he has learned the truth. Matty denies it and swears that she really does love him. To prove his suspicions are unfounded, Matty says she will go down to the boat house by herself. Matty opens the boat house door and then, unknown to Ned, secretly dives into the water and swims away. The boat house explodes a few seconds later.The dental records confirm that the real Matty Tyler\\'s body was in the boat house. The police believe that Matty Tyler Walker and Ned were responsible for Edmund\\'s death and that Matty Tyler Walker was killed in the boat house fire. Ned is charged with Edmund\\'s murder and convicted. The fake Matty retrieves the money from the overseas account and moves to an exotic land. While in prison, Ned obtains a copy of the Wheaton High School yearbook and his suspicions about the switched identities are confirmed when he sees the photos of Mary Ann and Matty. He knows that Mary Ann Simpson/Matty Tyler Walker has succeeded in achieving her high school goal.']], [['In 1958, in the French Alps, a young servant, Anna Jurin, arrives at Saint Ange Orphanage to work with Helena while the orphans are moved to new families.

This tension is introduced when Marie (Marie Herry) mentions the scary children. Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage; resulting in it being closed down, save for a single orphan. Alluded to early in the movie, things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage. The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past. This is because it was nothing unusual. An overworked, under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children, was unable to cope. Franchard poses the question, \"How many do you think we could save?\" This tension is not what drives the film; it provides context but not momentum.The introduction of the character Anna (Virginie Ledoyen) starts the build up of this tension. What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry. She is primed for this by a brief, single sentence exchange with Marie, the orphan who is leaving the grounds. Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith (Lou Doillon) who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means, despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka (Dorina Lazar) the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time. Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard (Catriona MacColl) the director of the orphanage. This discouragement is simply that - discouragement. Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna\\'s nosing about. They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past. They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious. For them, leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable.Judith, Franchard, and Helenka, were all present at the orphanage in 1946. The latter two discourage Anna; the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about. This sets up the basic tension of the film: Sanity v. Insanity. Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people. No frivolity, barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor. Judith must take drugs, treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka. As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things. In the end insanity wins the battle. This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit, well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children. This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children: they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them.There is little to explain Anna\\'s descent into insanity. The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer, evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant. The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear. That she does not want the baby is not really clear. She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby\\'s heartbeat. That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear. Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant, and knew before she arrived, she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby. Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange. This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is. There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane.']], [['Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.::IMDb Editors', 'Will, Lisa, and two of their friends attempt to flee man-made and natural disasters and encounter Batman, Hancock, The Hulk, Indiana Jones, Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, the Love Guru, Iron Man, rabid chipmunks amongst others in their seemingly vain efforts to seek help and shelter from unknown threats.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)'], 'Disaster Movie', ['Comedy'], [{'name': 'Matt Lanter', 'id': '1782667'}, {'name': 'Vanessa Lachey', 'id': '0591373'}, {'name': \"Gary 'G.

He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film\\'s opening day and Michael Jackson\\'s 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull \"Indiana Jones\". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he\\'s 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of \"Juno\" and Will\\'s best friend Calvin (Gary \"G-Thang\" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room \"Wanted\" to stop Seth and McLover \"Superbad\" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing \"Dr. Phil\" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the \"High School Musical\" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that \"Hannah Montana\" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up \"Hancock\" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the \"Sex and the City\" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage \"Don\\'t Mess With The Zohan\". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney\\'s water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a \"Jumper\" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian\\'s (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as \"the guy who ruined Star Wars\"; also a reference to Matt Lanter\\'s voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will\\'s dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the \"Enchanted\" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she\\'s a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she\\'s a \"demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\" due to consuming \"lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!\" After getting into a dance off with the Princess\\'s Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C\\'s \\'I Like Them Girls\\', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with \"Iron Man\" (Gerrard Fachinni), \"Hellboy\" (Barinholtz), and the \"Incredible Hulk\" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa\\'s mother, who is informed about Lisa\\'s death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney\\'s flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she\\'s trapped under a statue, they run into \"The Dark Night\" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it\\'s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills \"Speed Racer\" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will\\'s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive \"Night at the Museum\", including \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into \"Beowulf\" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will\\'s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by \"The Love Guru\" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain \"Disaster Movie F**k Song\" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.']], [['A writer looks back on his memorable 1986 Christmas, dealing with brothers, bullies, first love, pregnancy and family \"elving.\"::statmanjeff', 'The Buckley family, consisting of two parents, four pre-pubescent brothers and a baby on the way, deals with the antics of its young sons and their struggles with the Hagbart family during the Christmas season.

On the news, the story of a missing boy named Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) last seen with a man named Roy, traveling in a primer grey Chevelle.Roy (Michael Shannon) pulls back duct tape covering the peephole in the door and sees that its night. He tells Lucas (Joel Edgerton) that its time to go. They gather Alton, whos reading a comic book underneath a bed sheet. Hes wearing headphones and darkened swim goggles. They exit the room.The front desk clerk of the motel watches as the peculiar threesome get into a Chevelle. The news is on in the motel office too. She picks up the phone as the Chevelle drives away.Elsewhere, Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) tells Doak (Bill Camp) that he must get the boy back no matter what. They exit the room and we see theyre on the altar of a large congregation of religious followers. He starts reading scripture which sounds more like a series of dates and numbers. The FBI raids the church and we see that were in the compound of a Waco-like cult. They gather up the members of the congregation into school buses and take them away.Through their police scanner, Roy and Lucas discover the authorities have a description of their vehicle. Lucas puts on night vision goggles, turns off the headlines and speeds through the darkness. After driving through three counties, Roy tells him to turn the lights back on and slow down. As Lucas does, their car narrowly misses a stalled car in the middle of the road. However a vehicle heading in the opposite direction isnt as lucky and crashes into the stalled car. Lucas stops, gets out and checks on the driver. As he does, a State Trooper pulls up. The trooper is about to assist, when he gets a message on his radio about the Chevelle. Lucas pulls his own gun and tells the trooper not to do it. The trooper pulls his weapon anyway, so Lucas shoots him, gets back in the Chevelle and off they go. Roy assures Lucas that the trooper was wearing a vest.The FBI questions the members of the congregation about the large collection of weapons theyve started to amass. Calvin says its still currently legal to own guns in this country. We also find out that Calvin Meyer is Altons adopted father. Roy is his biological father. NSA agent Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) arrives and questions the congregation too. He asks about Altons powers. Calvin tells him that he speaks in tongues and has given the church a series of numbers. It turns out those numbers are classified government information. They also talk about the light Alton has in his eyes. Sevier lets everyone return to their church. Doak and Levi (Scott Haze) gather a secret stash of weapons and head out after Alton.Roy, Lucas and Alton get to the home of a former congregation member named Elden (David Jensen). He hides them and already has a darkened room for Alton to sleep. In the morning, the entire house is rumbling like theres an earthquake. Roy runs into Altons room and sees Elden staring in the bright lights shooting out of Altons eyes. They pull Elden away and get the goggles back on Alton. Elden explains that he just had to see it one more time. Lucas takes the man's car and gathers Alton. Roy pulls his gun on Elden and tells him that he has to do this because the man knows too much. He begs Roy to spare him.Alton reads comic books in the back of Eldens stolen utility van and asks questions about Superman and Kryptonite. Roy admonishes Lucas for letting him read that. Lucas defends his decision by saying that its good to read. Roy doesnt want Alton reading stuff that isnt real. We get the sense that, before all this, Lucas wasnt a member of the Meyer family like Roy was. Alton starts speaking in Spanish. Lucas is surprised he can do that. Roy says he cant and turns on the radio. It turns out that Alton is reciting what a DJ is saying on a Spanish speaking radio station even though the radio wasnt even turned on. Roy was able to determine that the numbers Alton was saying to the church were coordinates with a corresponding date. He needs to get him to those coordinates by that day a few days from now.They end up at a gas station. Lucas goes inside to get supplies. Roy makes a phone call and tells Alton to stay in the van. Roy tells the person on the phone that he misses them and will see them in a few hours. Something above catches Altons attention and he gets out and wanders away to the edge of the parking lot. Roy runs over and Alton apologizes and points to the sky. Fiery debris rains from the sky onto the gas station. Lucas and Roy take Alton, get in the van and drive away as the gas station explodes behind them.They go to the home of Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). Shes Altons mom and concerned that hes not looking too well. She puts him to sleep.Re-joining Sevier and Agent Miller (Paul Sparks) from the FBI at the aftermath of the gas station, we find out that a defence satellite in charge of stopping nuclear weapons exploded and crashed at the gas station. Theres a heat reading comparable to a nuclear bomb where Alton was standing when the satellite exploded, but there isnt any radiation present at the site. They determine they can program a drone to track that exact same reading, so next time Altons super powers flare, they can figure out where he is.Doak and Levi, armed with duct tape and guns, pay a visit to Sarahs mom.On the radio, the official report is that a weather satellite crashed.Lucas works on rigging up Sarahs car with some equipment while she makes small talk. We find out that Lucas was a childhood friend of Roys before he left to join Calvins cult. His job before all of this, he was also a State Trooper. Sarah couldnt handle seeing Calvin raise her child, so she left the cult. Roy bravely stayed behind to keep an eye on Alton.Doak and Levi go to Sarahs house and find Eldens van. Then they go to Eldens house and find him alive. Roy couldnt kill him after all. They ask where the heroes are headed.Our heroes drive and suddenly Alton has difficulty breathing. They pull over and try to help him. Lucas insists they should go to the hospital, but Roy says they cant. If they do, they wont be able to get to the coordinates. Light shoots out of Altons eyes and he cant control it. They take him out of the car. The grass around him starts to die. He recovers and tells Sarah and Lucas to go. He points to a distant light in the sky the government knows where they are.Roy and Alton flee into the woods and find a cave. Alton tells Roy that he needs to be outside in the day time. Roy says that could harm him. Alton says that Roy needs to trust him. In the morning, Alton and Roy watch the sunrise. Alton recovers completely and his hand illuminates with light.Sevier decodes the numbers from Calvins sermons. Theyre a series of coordinates with corresponding dates. Some line up to stuff like where the State Trooper was shot and where the gas station explosion happened. Others are just government secrets. Putting the government numbers aside, Sevier is able to find out where our heroes are headed next!Lucas and Sarah are holed up in a hotel room. Sarah reassures Lucas that Roy wont stop at anything to get Alton where they need to be. Theres a knock. It cant be Roy and Alton because its daytime. Wrong! Its them. Roy says that Alton was able to show him a glimpse of where he needs to be. Alton explains that he belongs with people who live on a plane of existence thats parallel to ours, but different from ours. He shows Lucas that place through the lights in his eyes. Lucas now believes.Lucas puts on his Kevlar vest and goes out to get their car. As soon as he opens the door, hes shot by Doak and Levi. Ray grabs his gun and exits the room too, but hes shot in the neck. Doak and Levi break in the room and take Alton. They zip tie Lucas, Ray and Sarah and drive away. Sarah breaks free and rescues the other two. They head off after the kidnappers, but the trip is short. Theyre stuck in the traffic of a military roadblock. Ray goes off road to get to the front and there they see a military helicopter flying away from Doak pick up. Inside the open truck, the blanket that Doak used to cover Altons head. It's over.At a military compound a group of military leaders and scientists try to talk to Alton. He could be a valuable asset. He says that hell talk to Sevier and only to Sevier, so everyone else leaves. Using telekinetic powers, Alton is able to make it so the security cameras arent recording the actual present events. He telekinetically opens the door which imprisons him. Sevier sheepishly goes inside to talk to Alton. Alton shows him his light.In the middle of nowhere, Roy is devastated that he failed.

He handcuffs himself with Lucas cuffs and asks if Lucas would be willing to punch him which Lucas has no interest in doing.Alton tells Roy that theres one route they can go to get through the government roadblocks keeping them from their final destination. Roy and Sarah also come to terms with the fact that Alton might not belong with them after all and that once they get there, its goodbye.They drive through a small military blockade on a country road. Alton and Sarah get out of the car and run through swamp land. Roy and Lucas keep the military occupied while driving in Sarahs, now badly damaged, car.As if by magic, a dome appears around Alton that takes up a good third of the United States. Everywhere, everyone sees this magical world where Alton belongs. All of the beings that inhabit that world are made of light that comes from their hands and eyes, kind of like an evolved version of Alton. Lucas and Roys car crashes. Alton and Sarah share a goodbye glance and then as suddenly as everything appeared, it, along with Alton disappears.AFTERMATHLucas is being questioned by the government. His incredible story is the only story he has to tell. Sarah cuts her hair in a scummy bathroom clearly on the run. Roy is in a prison. He has electrodes on his head and stares into the sun. His eyes magically illuminate like a lesser version of Altons.\\n\"]], [['Joshua Hayward is a single parent who has his hands full with his daughter Sarah who wants to elope with her motorcycle driving boyfriend.
